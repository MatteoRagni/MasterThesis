In this chapter we explore the searching algorithm applied to a dynamic simulated device really close to our drone. The simulation will use a simpler control model (LQR) and will implement the perception action paradigm for the searching part. Searching part will be performed with device implemented in previous chapter, with auxiliary range finder for obstacle avoidance and altitude keeping. All those elements build what is called avionic framework of the drone. The basic idea is to create a stacked structure that could be easily expanded in future; again, what we are discussing in an initial platform that could be improved with the use of more increasingly complex sensor--fusion, that allows to exploit the most sophisticated searching algorithm possible.
