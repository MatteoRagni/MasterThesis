In this chapter we will try to design a digital receiver for the ARTVA signal. Before starting with the design, \emph{ARTVA signal} is analyzed in detail, with the derivation of a simplified model of field pattern that could be used  for the implementation of the searching algorithm. After, ferrite antennas are analyzed, as they are the only way to receive such a long wavelength. In the last part of the chapter the circuitry for the ARTVA receiver is shown.

\section{Analytical signal analysis - A1--A \label{sec:a1asegnale}}

The ARTVA signal is a wild-life tag, specifically an \textbf{A--1A} signal. From the normative\cite{NormativaARVA}:
\begin{itemize}
\item A1A Signal:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item amplitude modulated signal
	\item digital information (keying)
	\item carrier frequency: \num{457}\si{\kilo\hertz}
	\item no auxiliary carrier
	\item frequency error shall not exceed $\pm$\num{80}\si{\hertz}
	\end{itemize}
\item carrier keying characteristics:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item on-time: \num{70}\si{\milli\second} minimum
	\item off-time: \num{400}\si{\milli\second} minimum
	\item period: \num{1000}\si{\milli\second} $\pm$ \num{300}\si{\milli\second}
	\end{itemize}
\item H--field peak at \num{10}\si{\meter}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item must be greater than \num{0.5}\si{\micro\ampere\per\meter}
	\item must be lower than \num{2.23}\si{\micro\ampere\per\meter}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The variable duty cycle is a challenge for the formulation of a searching algorithm, with a duty cycle ($\dutycycle$) that varies from a minimum of 5.4\% to a maximum of 42.9\%. The amplitude modulation, from a mathematical point of view is:
\begin{equation}
\jtx(t) = \braces{1+\mu \,\jint}\ccos{\omegaarva t}
\end{equation}

There are 3 key elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\jint$ is the current of the intelligence signal, the representation of the square wave in figure \ref{fig:squarewave}:
\begin{equation}
\jint(t) = A\dutycycle + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\braces{\dfrac{2A}{n\pi}\ssin{n\pi \dutycycle} \ccos{\omegaint n t}}
\end{equation}
in which $A$ represents the signal amplitude and $\Delta$ is the duty cycle. 
\item the frequency of the carrier signal is $f_0 = 2\phi\omegaarva$, and it is \num{457}\si{\kilo\hertz}
\item $\mu$ is called modulation factor
\end{itemize}
From this current we are able to obtain the magnitude of dipole magnetic vector, using equation \ref{eq:dipolodacorrente}. Many of those parameter are device dependent and not known.
