% ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The aim of the thesis is to inspect and derive a model for an autonomous VTOL that helps Mountain Rescue in finding the position of buried person under avalanche.

\noindent
The first part of the thesis will inspect the state of the art in buried searching, ARTVA transmitter and searching algorithms. Also we will show some of the requirements for a searching drone.

\noindent
In the second chapter we will expose the problem of searching the position of a transmission source in near-field with ferromagnetic antennas. The chapter will be closed with a design for an analog ARTVA receiver

\noindent
In the third chapter, a new kind of searching algorithm will be defined, including routines of obstacle-avoidance and altitude-keeping. 

\noindent
In the fourth chapter, a model of an hexa-copter and its stabilization controls are derived and than simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The loop is closed on some of the searching algorithm defined in the previous chapter. Results of searching routine are shown and critically examined.

\noindent
The last chapter will take into account all the results to derive some conclusions about the stated problem, with some suggestions for further improvements.
