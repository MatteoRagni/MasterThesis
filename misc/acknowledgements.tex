There are so many person that helped me through this journey, that I should write an entire thesis only to name them all. But few of them actively suggested me the solution that you find in this text. First of all, Ermes Floriani, that started this project; the men and women of Italian Mountain Rescue Team, that risk their life every day to save person in danger, and helped us in finding information for develop a drone that could be really helpful; Ing. Paolo Bosetti and Ing. Francesco Biral that always believed and inspired me during the Master Course; Luigi Ghinassi, who gave me the intellectual instruments to understand and develop an ARTVA prototype; Matteo Cocetti, that has shared with me his genuine and innate mastering of mathematics and problem solving; my father that has always tried to find a solution for some of the usolveable problem that I've encountered.

\noindent
There are many others, maybe not cited here, but firmly present in my heart. Thank you all.
